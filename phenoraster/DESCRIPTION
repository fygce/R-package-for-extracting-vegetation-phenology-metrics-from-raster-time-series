Description: 
    Functions for extracting vegetation phenology (SOS, EOS, POS) from raster time series
    using double-logistic (DL) fitting. Applicable to global raster datasets and flexible
    for other regularly sampled temporal raster stacks. Implements relative amplitude
    thresholds for robust seasonal detection.
