Description: 
    Tools for extracting vegetation phenology metrics (Start of Season, Peak of Season, 
    End of Season) from raster time series using double-logistic (DL) curve fitting. 
    The package implements three phenology extraction strategies inspired by the TIMESAT 
    framework: (1) a multi-year climatological relative threshold method (TS3), 
    (2) a year-specific dynamic threshold method (TS1), and 
    (3) a second-order derivative-based method (D2). 
    These methods are suitable for a wide range of regularly sampled raster datasets, 
    including CMIP6 monthly gross primary productivity (GPP) and high-temporal-resolution 
    vegetation indices such as GIMMS NDVI3g+ and MODIS products.
