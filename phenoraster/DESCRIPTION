Description: 
    Functions for extracting vegetation phenology metrics (SOS, EOS, POS) from raster time series 
    using double-logistic (DL) curve fitting. The package supports both relative (multi-year 
    climatological) and dynamic (year-specific) threshold strategies for seasonal detection. 
    Originally designed for large-scale CMIP6 GPP datasets, it is also applicable to other 
    regularly sampled raster time series.
